## October 2

We began to build our body on Wednesday, October 1st, where we mapped out a sketch of our robot structure first on the board.
Because we envisioned our robot (the best friend of the wife) to be a gorgeous baddie, we decided to give her an hourglass figure with a snatched waist and voluminous upper and lower body silhouette. We also planned to have servo motors for her waist and her head so that she can shake/rotate her hips and toss her hair back. Here's a picture of our plan:
![20251001_210047](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2654d355-31cb-466c-b95e-ebd8593eb330)

Then we started working on the lower torso of her body first, which we decided to build out of cardboard, but with many reinforcements, so that it's not floppy. We ended up gluing on a bunch of smaller cardboards onto the big cardboard cutout, which were being used for the shape of the torso, so that they're firm and sturdy.

Oh, and we also had this ONE error that we just could not solve, and after an hour and a half of wrestling with our robot base with Professor Michael, we realized that there was ONE blob of solder that wasn't actually soldered onto the board, which was what was causing one of our wheels to only go forward and not reverse. Once we figured out the problem and fixed it, we realized what euphoria feels like.

(look at how happy Jiho is after both of our wheels were finally working!)

## October 7

We were continuing our robot's body today, and we finished up till the first half of the robot body and successfully closed off the four sides of the torso with a rectangle cardboard piece glued on the top to secure them altogether & also to serve as the placement for our first servo motor, which is going to be at the waist of the robot so that we can rotate her hips. 
![IMG-20251002-WA0006](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de08f13f-3498-495f-afa7-b222c9004116)

The overall challenges with building the body were making sure all the measurements were correct so that the pieces fitted well together (sometimes, even if we measured these pieces correctly, they didn't exactly fit well together). Another challenge was trying to hot glue all the sides of the pieces, because some of these were in tricky places, so we had to crawl inside the torso in order to glue them, just like how Jiho was doing in the photo below.

But now that we're done with the lower torso, we can move to working on the top half & attaching the servo motor at the waist!

## October 9

In this class, our main objective was to get the big servo motor onto the waist part of our robot because we were done with the lower torso.
This turned out to be much more troublesome and complicated than we thought, because we had to measure where the holes should be drilled on the waist part from the inside of the torso, and aligning the holes was an extremely difficult task.

We had a total of three layers we needed to drill through (two wooden boards on either side of the piece of cardboard that was sandwiched in the middle), and we were sketching out the approximate hole locations onto the top wooden board, drilled the holes in, and then tried to fit the motor from the other side (from the inside of the torso) as pictured below.

But this took a lot of trial and error because once we had two holes drilled through, matching the third one up was difficult, so we tried different methods, such as trying to fit the motor in from the outside of the torso in a reversal method, as pictured below.

And finally, we successfully fitted the motor from the inside of the torso after taking the professor's advice and making the holes slightly larger so that there's a bit of a wiggle room for the motor's stick to turn in & also make the process easier in general. However, this meant that we'd have to use small washers to make sure that the bolts aren't too loose now that the holes are bigger.

We also had a couple of side quests going on, such as trying to attach the wooden boards onto the robot base that will help with balancing and taking on the weight of our robot's torso -- we successfully cut all the necessary boards in the Scene Shop, but we ended up having to redo one of them because unfortunately it split during the drilling process. :(

By the end of the break & start of next class (on Tuesday), we aim to have the lazy susan attached, as well as the two wooden boards at the bottom of the base.

## October 20

After coming back from break, we immediately started working on making progress on our robot, as we had quite a few tasks to get done for our midterm progress on Thursday:
- attach the lower body to the wheel base
- attach the lazy susan and giant servo motor
- build the upper body (which was finished on this day)
- upper body controlled by the giant servo with Arduino and 12V power

We started by building the upper body with cardboard, and we revised some calculations for the lengths of our upper/lower body as well as the head/neck by drawing out a quick diagram to flush out our thoughts on the board.
![20251020_205931](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d5ec361-bba3-4175-a379-22a89d5fc024)

Then we measured and cut out the upper torso's sides, which were a total of 8 sides with 4 of them being 33cm (width) x 30cm (height) and the other 4 being 33 cm (width) x 10cm (height). 
![20251020_210241](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/022b73e4-321c-4161-992c-3d3310b7b92d)

The first 4 pieces (the bigger ones that are for the bust) were then glued together & reinforced:
![20251020_2![20251020_222011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a533a3ea-892a-4113-accf-391f0b2cf4f5)
22003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4619299f-e26e-4b0b-8d7c-b820baa564cb)

Then the next 4 pieces (the smaller ones that are for the waist) were glued onto that, which was the final result of our upper torso:
![20251020_223259](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0200241d-02a6-4d9e-bf94-7b5a9bac2d4a)

Next step is to attach the lower body to the wheel base (which will be done by attaching two wooden planks onto the base), and also attach the lazy susan & take out the servo motor and figure out the wiring.

## October 21

Today Jiho and I began by cutting the wooden boards for our base as well as the upper torso's motor, which were done in the scene shop.
![20251021_135813](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0cb623-0deb-4430-8dc5-177af850f69d)

Then we drilled holes through both of the wooden boards & through the base, and secured them together with nuts and bolts after measuring approximately where we should position the boards on the base.

## October 22

At this point, we still had the following things left on our to-do list till Thursday:
- attach the lower body to the wheel base
- attach the lazy susan and giant servo motor
- upper body controlled by the giant servo with Arduino and 12V power

We began by cutting out a large rectangle from the back of the lower torso, so that we could access the motor by reaching inside the robot through this new gap.
![20251022_194231](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3355256a-8883-46b5-ad7a-ba0df76bdac9)

Then we realized that our robot torso was starting to tilt forward due to the weight, so we decided to place some pieces of cardboard between the robot torso and the wooden planks attached to the base, which solved the problem.
![20251022_200803](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18061d7f-2973-4a4a-9fe4-75ba93ce80e2)
![20251022_202705](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/541f1a90-2a1e-4c21-a490-d9c02d68e7db)

After that, we decided to attach the L-bridge to all four sides of our torso so that our torso would be secured to the two wooden plank strips on the base, which meant that we were done with attaching the lower body to the wheel base!
![20251022_200148](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c61b92c-b901-4d9b-9cb1-1fd5230ec85f)
![20251022_194242](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f89d6fd8-dde9-47b4-b49e-b86ffa0ae2ee)

And finally, we made the upper body out of cardboard again, and also made the lid of the upper base, on which we glued on two smaller wooden boards so that it's sturdier. 
![20251022_203912](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33212f22-a8e2-4cbd-99e4-08f4a1a913ac)
![20251022_203919](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb0ba16-62b3-4acd-ba0c-cd86f7fe8c8d)

Then we tried attaching the lazy susan from the inside of the robot, but it turned out to be more difficult than we thought because we had to 1) align the holes together, 2) push the bolt through, and then 3) hold the bolt while screwing it from the inside. But we ended up successfully getting it done.
![20251022_211446](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/980d842a-3db3-4180-8ec9-0d2f4c71a9e4)
![20251022_211326](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8640d8f4-4dc7-4278-a8ea-9430816fafa6)

So by the end of this day, we had:
- attach the lower body to the wheel base (completed this day)
- attach the lazy susan and giant servo motor
done.

## October 23

The only thing we had left in our agenda was having the upper body be controlled by the giant servo with Arduino and 12V power, which we started working on once we received the Arduino mega from Professor Shiloh.
The wiring process basically went down like this:
- First and foremost, we had to unscrew the motor from its place because we needed it to do the wiring, and because it was already attached to the top of the lower body, we couldn't access it unless we crawled into the robot again. So for convenience, we just detached it from the body.
- We attached two wires from the motor's + and - sides into the 12V battery's + and - sides.
- Then we had two wires that were attached to GND and pin 7.

After doing so and testing to see if the code works, we changed our jumper wires to normal wires, and changed our board to Arduino Mega.
![20251023_151705](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0edbdd7-0c5d-4503-ba2b-ba93dbfc907d)
![20251023_151712](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c42b0fdc-81cc-4218-b474-c04fc58c5c0f)

![20251023_151723](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa1a41b-e6d8-488c-8577-6265c22dd748)

But then when we were trying to run the code through the circuit, it kept giving us errors -- at first, it told us this: "avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00 avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding." Upon research, we realized that this means that it isn't the code's problem, but there's something wrong with the connection with the board. Then we got this error: "avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage(): timeout" which was also related to the connection with the board. So we ended up switching our connector cord and it started working, haha. The correct port appeared so we selected that, and the code was running fine!
Then we asked Mustafa about what code he used to test the motor's movement, and he told us that we can use the Sweep code that's already written in Arduino and just change the pin so that it's in accordance to whichever pin we were using.

The code was the following:
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo
// twelve servo objects can be created on most boards

int pos = 0;    // variable to store the servo position

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(7);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15 ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15 ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
}

And we saw that the motor was rotating fine, albeit slowly, so we decide to reattach the motor back into the torso. With this, our checklist for our midterm check was complete (except we couldn't attach the upper body because the rod of the motor wasn't long enough).
![20251023_165602](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6fe1805-8dcf-43e7-afe7-cf5fa8a8edee)
![20251023_165611](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df544df3-b050-4ece-87c6-43a03e5a95c7)

Oh, and we also detached our torso from the base because we needed to take the motor out, so we put back the L-bridge in there, too.
![20251023_170025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ebe6c97-8de5-457a-810f-ab7a3999a41a)

Next step on the agenda is to: 1) attach the upper torso onto the lazy susan & the motor, 2) start crafting the neck and the head, and 3) figure out the motors for the hands & the eyelids (which are the other two parts of our robot that's going to move).
