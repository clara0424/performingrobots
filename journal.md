## October 2

We began to build our body on Wednesday, October 1st, where we mapped out a sketch of our robot structure first on the board.
Because we envisioned our robot (the best friend of the wife) to be a gorgeous baddie, we decided to give her an hourglass figure with a snatched waist and voluminous upper and lower body silhouette. We also planned to have servo motors for her waist and her head so that she can shake/rotate her hips and toss her hair back. Here's a picture of our plan:

Then we started working on the lower torso of her body first, which we decided to build out of cardboard, but with many reinforcements, so that it's not floppy. We ended up gluing on a bunch of smaller cardboards onto the big cardboard cutout, which were being used for the shape of the torso, so that they're firm and sturdy.

Oh, and we also had this ONE error that we just could not solve, and after an hour and a half of wrestling with our robot base with Professor Michael, we realized that there was ONE blob of solder that wasn't actually soldered onto the board, which was what was causing one of our wheels to only go forward and not reverse. Once we figured out the problem and fixed it, we realized what euphoria feels like.

(look at how happy Jiho is after both of our wheels were finally working!)

## October 6

We were continuing our robot's body today, and we finished up till the first half of the robot body and successfully closed off the four sides of the torso with a rectangle cardboard piece glued on the top to secure them altogether & also to serve as the placement for our first servo motor, which is going to be at the waist of the robot so that we can rotate her hips.

The overall challenges with building the body were making sure all the measurements were correct so that the pieces fitted well together (sometimes, even if we measured these pieces correctly, they didn't exactly fit well together). Another challenge was trying to hot glue all the sides of the pieces, because some of these were in tricky places, so we had to crawl inside the torso in order to glue them, just like how Jiho was doing in the photo below.

But now that we're done with the lower torso, we can move to working on the top half & attaching the servo motor at the waist!
