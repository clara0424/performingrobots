## October 2

We began to build our body on Wednesday, October 1st, where we mapped out a sketch of our robot structure first on the board.
Because we envisioned our robot (the best friend of the wife) to be a gorgeous baddie, we decided to give her an hourglass figure with a snatched waist and volumous upper and lower body silouette. We also planned to have servo motors for her waist and her head so that she can shake/rotate her hips and toss her hair back. Here's a picture of our plan:

Then we started working on the lower torso of her body first, which we decided to build out of cardboard but with many enforcements so that it's not floppy. We ended up glueing on a bunch of smaller cardboards onto the big cardboard cutout which were being used for the shape of the torso so that they're firm and sturdy.

Oh, and we also had this ONE error that we just could not solve, and after an hour and a half of wrestling with our robot base with professor Michael, we realized that there was ONE blob of solder that wasn't actually soldered onto the board, which was what was causing one of our wheels to only go forward and not reverse. Once we figured out the problem and fixed it, we realized what euphoria feels like.
